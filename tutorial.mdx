There are several parameters you need to understand:

- **Tick:** *the unique identifier of a Suirc20 token series*
- **Total supply:** *the maximum supply amount of a Suirc20 token*
- **Minted:** *how many tokens have been minted by users for the particular Suirc20*
- **Progress:** *the proportion of the minted amount to the total supply of this Suirc20*
- **Holders:** *how many unique wallet addresses are holding this Suirc20*
- **Limit (limit per mint):** *the maximum minted amount allowed for a single mint*

## **Mint an Inscription**

If you want to mint a particular Suirc20 inscription, move to the **“Inscribe”** page and select the **“Mint”** tag. **Enter the tick** of the inscription you would like to mint, **enter the amount** you want for a single mint (can’t exceed the limit per mint for this particular inscription) and **how many mints** you want to repeat. Currently you can repeat up to 10 mints each time.

After entering all the inputs, click **“Next”** to call your wallet to proceed. You need to **approve corresponding times** for minting transactions in your wallet just **as the “Repeat” times** you selected. After you approve all the transactions, your minting request will be fully completed.

## **Deploy a New Inscription**

If you are an expert of inscription and want to initiate a brand new Suirc20 inscription series to promote it to the public, you can deploy your own.

Just switch the tag to **“Deploy”** under the **“Inscribe”** page. Set a unique **Tick** name for the new inscription (can’t be the same as existing ones, which will be rejected). And then set the **Total Supply** and **Limit Per Mint** for your inscription.

Besides, you need to set the **Mint Fee** for your inscriptions, which determines how many SUI tokens users need to spend for a single mint.

To avoid your inscriptions from being completely minted in too short a time, you also need to set a limit for **Max Mint Per Minute**, indicating up to how many mint times are allowed for your series for each minute.

After completing all the inputs, click **“Next”** to execute your deploy request.
